I am a Research Fellow in Statistics at the University of St Andrews. I work on ecological problems, e.g., estimating the size of wild animal populations, quantifying how populations change over time, or finding out how animals move around. 

I am actively developing software to implement my research methods, e.g. r-glennie/openpopscr and r-glennie/moveds. 

Full details on my current research projects can be found at www.richardglennie.co.uk. 

I can be contacted by email rg374@st-andrews.ac.uk or on twitter @richard_glennie if you'd like to discuss a research project. If you have any questions or issues with code in my repositories (which is without warranty) then please open an issue in the corresponding github repository.
